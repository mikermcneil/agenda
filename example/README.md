# Dumb Example

> Note that this example is really just set up to prove a point-- the really cool thing about this module is its ability to run every process as the "master" AND/OR a "slave", and to change that status out at any time (which makes it ideal for a distributed that scales horizontally)



1. Open a terminal window and cd into the root of this module.  Then run:

```bash
$ node example/master
```

2. Open _another_ terminal window and cd into the root of this module.  Then run:

```bash
$ node example/master
```

3. Open _another_ terminal window and cd into the root of this module.  Then run:

```bash
$ node example/master
```

4. Open _another_ terminal window and cd into the root of this module.  Then run:

```bash
$ node example/master
```




You get the idea.
